Service catalog
---------------

The service catalog is a replacement for the GLPI's simplified interface.

It is enabled on a per entity basis and exists in two flavors

* simplified
* extended

To enable it, edit an entity, open the `Forms` tab and set the field `Helpdesk mode` to `Service catalog simplified` or `Service catalog extended`. This setting handles inheritance from parent entity to children entities.

Users using the simplified interface will benefit a new interface allowing them to:

* browse forms and FAQ with the unified interface
* follow the process of their requests
* book assets
* view their feeds

Users using the extended interface have a more complete view on their requests.

Forms with `Direct access on homepage` enabled and `FAQ items` in the `Knowledge base` will will appear in the interface. Users may search by browsing the categories on the left of the screen, and may also search for forms or FAQ with a natural language search engine.

FAQ items needs to be associated to knowledge base categories. The knowledge base categories must be associated to form categories (available in `Setup > Dropdowns : Forms > Form categories`) to show their content.
